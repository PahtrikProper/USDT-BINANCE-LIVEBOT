# Binance Automated Trading Bot White Paper

## Abstract

This document presents the design and implementation of an automated trading bot for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. The bot is designed to autonomously execute trading strategies based on real-time market data analysis, providing users with a tool to capitalize on market opportunities. The bot utilizes Python and the ccxt library to interact with the Binance API, analyzing order books and recent trades to inform its trading decisions.

## Introduction

Cryptocurrency trading is a highly dynamic and volatile market, requiring continuous monitoring and rapid decision-making. Manual trading can be both time-consuming and prone to emotional biases. An automated trading bot addresses these challenges by consistently applying predefined strategies and executing trades without human intervention.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the Binance Automated Trading Bot are:
1. To automate the process of analyzing market data and executing trades.
2. To provide a configurable platform for users to define their trading strategies and risk parameters.
3. To ensure compliance with Binance API rate limits and implement effective logging for monitoring and debugging.

## Features

### Order Book Analysis
The bot fetches and analyzes the order book for the specified trading pair to determine market conditions, including best ask and bid prices, volume imbalance, and significant sell walls.

### Recent Trades Analysis
It retrieves and analyzes recent trades to identify average prices and trends, providing a comprehensive view of market activity.

### Automated Trading
Based on the analyzed data and user-defined parameters, the bot autonomously places buy and sell orders on Binance, aiming to maximize profitability.

### Rate Limiting
The bot implements rate limiting to comply with Binance API limits, ensuring it operates within the allowed request rates.

### Logging
Detailed logging is implemented to capture important information and errors, facilitating monitoring and debugging.

## System Design

### Architecture
The bot's architecture comprises several key modules:
- **Market Data Module**: Fetches market data from Binance, including order books, recent trades, and OHLCV data.
- **Analysis Module**: Analyzes fetched data to derive insights such as RSI, volume imbalance, and market conditions.
- **Trading Module**: Makes trading decisions based on analysis and executes orders through the Binance API.
- **Config Module**: Manages user-defined parameters and configurations.
- **Logging Module**: Records important events and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.

### Implementation

#### Market Data Module
The market data module uses the ccxt library to interact with the Binance API, fetching order book data, recent trades, and OHLCV data. The data is processed and passed to the analysis module for further examination.

#### Analysis Module
The analysis module performs several key functions:
- **RSI Calculation**: Computes the Relative Strength Index (RSI) based on OHLCV data to identify overbought and oversold conditions.
- **Order Book Analysis**: Analyzes the order book to determine the best ask and bid prices, volume imbalance, and market condition.
- **Recent Trades Analysis**: Analyzes recent trades to calculate average and lowest prices, providing insights into market trends.

#### Trading Module
The trading module makes trading decisions based on the analysis results and user-defined parameters. It places buy and sell orders on Binance, monitors the status of open orders, and updates balances accordingly.

#### Config Module
The config module manages user-defined parameters and configurations, including trading pair, order book depth, trade amount, interval between trades, minimum profit percentage, and rate limiting parameters.

#### Logging Module
The logging module captures detailed logs of the bot's operations, including information on placed orders, errors, and market analysis results.

## Configurable Parameters

The bot allows users to configure various parameters through the `config.py` script:

- `SYMBOL`: The trading pair symbol (e.g., 'ETH/USDT').
- `ORDER_BOOK_DEPTH`: The depth of the order book to fetch (default is 200).
- `TRADE_AMOUNT`: The amount of USDT to trade in each buy order (default is 400 USDT).
- `TRADE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: The interval between each trade attempt (default is 5 seconds).
- `MIN_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE`: The minimum profit percentage to aim for when placing sell orders (default is 0.003 or 0.3%).
- `MAX_SYMBOL_BALANCE_USDT_EQUIV`: The maximum equivalent USDT value of the symbol balance to hold (default is 50 USDT).
- `RSI_PERIOD`: The period for calculating RSI (default is 14).
- `RSI_OVERBOUGHT`: The RSI threshold for overbought condition (default is 66.8).
- `RSI_OVERSOLD`: The RSI threshold for oversold condition (default is 33.45).
- `VOLUME_IMBALANCE_THRESHOLD`: The threshold for volume imbalance to determine market conditions (default is 1.15).
- `SIGNIFICANT_VOLUME_MULTIPLIER`: The multiplier to identify significant volume in the order book (default is 3).
- `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`: The maximum number of API requests per minute (default is 1100).
- `RATE_LIMIT_SAFETY_FACTOR`: A safety factor to apply to the rate limit (default is 0.75).

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install ccxt python-dotenv
